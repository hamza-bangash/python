# Python Practice & Problem Solving

This repository contains my daily Python practice focused on improving problem-solving skills and Python syntax.

I solve problems regularly from platforms like LeetCode and Codeforces to build strong fundamentals in algorithms, data structures, and logical thinking.

## What I Practice
- Core Python  
- Data Structures & Algorithms  
- LeetCode problems  
- Codeforces practice  
- Basic data handling with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  

## Goal
The goal of this repo is consistency and improvement  writing clean Python, understanding edge cases, and getting better at breaking down problems.
